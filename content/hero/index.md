I'm an Korea based software developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently I have completed the software developer program at [SpartaCodingClub](https://spartacodingclub.kr/) and I used to work as a middle manager at a sewing factory in Myanmar. [Related Articles](https://www.worldkorean.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=34131).

I blog about what I studied for a day. [TIL](https://dawnpast12.tistory.com/).
It's so much fun learning new things. [GIT](https://github.com/nmdkims)!
